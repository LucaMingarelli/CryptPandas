        Performing specific queries and returning the results into *pandas dataframes* is easy:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import cryptpandas as crp
        
        df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1,2,3],
                           'B': ['one', 'one', 'four']})
        
        crp.write_encrypted(df, path='file.crypt', password='mypassowrd123')
        
        decrypted_df = crp.read_encrypted(path='file.crypt', password='mypassowrd123')
        
        print((df == decrypted_df).all().all())
        ```
        
        
        
        ### Requirements
